# Hi There!
I am a 21-year-old passionate Computer Science student. I'm currently pursuing my Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence.  
My main interests are Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, but I'm fond of everything that concerns intelligence, creativity, and beauty: I devote myself to sports, readings, music (I have played both the piano and the guitar ever since I was a kid), and even chess!
