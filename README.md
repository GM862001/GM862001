# Hi There!
I am a 20 year old passionate Computer Science student and I'm currently pursuing my Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence.
My main academic interests are Software Engineering, Machine Learning and Data Science, and I'm practicing to prepare myself for interviews to get interniships and acquire new experiences in these fields.
I'm fond of everything that concerns intelligence, creativity and beauty: I devote myself to sports, readings, music (I play both the piano and the guitar since I was a kid), and even chess!
